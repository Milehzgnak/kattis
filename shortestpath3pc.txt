1.Use Bellman Ford algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source vertex
  v represents vertex 0 to n-1
  e represents directed edge from vertex u to v with weight w
  for every v
    D[v] = INF
  D[s] = 0
  for 1 to V-1
    for every edge e
      if (D[u] != INF and D[v] > D[u] + w)
        D[v] = D[u] + w
  
  all vertices should have found their shortest path from source after v-1 relaxations
 
  run Bellman Ford again
  for 1 to V-1
    for every edge e
      if (D[u] != INF and D[v] > D[u] + w)
        D[v] = -INF

  if vertex v is still able to be relaxed, it means its connected to/ or part of a -ve
  weighted cycle. Hence we assign -INF to D[v]
  
  if D[v] = INF (not reachable from source)
    print "impossible"
  if D[v] = -INF (abitrarily short path from s to v)
    print "-Infinity"
  else:
    print D[v]
